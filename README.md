# VCPowerpoint
Version control for powerpoint slides

## Requirements
7-Zip, and it needs to have installed with the 7z executable added to your path

Powerpoint, but this is not really needed to use the batch files

## Usage
Say we want to explode the binary Demo.pptx for better version control

    .\explode Demo

will create a folder called Demo with the contents of the powerpoint

    .\implode Demo

will turn a folder called Demo into a powerpoint file that can be opened and edited

## Why use this instead of OneDrive or Dropbox?
How should I know?
